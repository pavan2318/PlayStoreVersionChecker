# GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker
## Introduction
Welcome to the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker project!
### Overview
The GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker is a Python script designed to retrieve the current running version of an application on the Google Play Store. This script aims to simplify the process of obtaining the latest version information of an application by automating the retrieval from the Google Play Store website.
### Benefits
Using the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker script provides several benefits:
- **Convenience**: Instead of manually visiting the Play Store website and searching for the application's version, this script automates the process, saving time and effort.
- **Automation**: The script fetches the application version by searching for a specific HTML element in the Play Store webpage's response. It eliminates the need for manual inspection or data extraction.
- **Integration**: The script can be easily integrated into other projects or workflows, allowing developers to programmatically retrieve the current version information for their applications.
### Prerequisites and Dependencies
Before using the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker script, ensure you have the following prerequisites and dependencies in place:
- **Python**: The script requires Python 3.x to run. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Requests Library**: The script uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the Play Store website. You can install it using `pip` with the following command: `pip install requests`
- **Beautiful Soup**: The script utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse and extract data from HTML content. Install it using `pip` with the following command: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
## Installation

```
### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Navigate to the project directory by executing the following command:
```
cd GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker
```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies
The script relies on the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. Install them by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Run the Script
You are now ready to run the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker script. Execute the following command:
```

```
The script will prompt you to enter the Google Play Store URL for the application. Once you provide the URL, it will fetch the current running version of the application and display it on the console.

## Usage
To use the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker script, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Run the Script
Execute the following command to run the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker script:
```
python googleplay_version_checker.py
```
### Step 2: Enter the Google Play Store URL
The script will prompt you to enter the Google Play Store URL for the application. Provide the URL as requested. For example:
```
Enter the Google Play Store URL for the application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app
```
### Step 3: Retrieve the Application Version
Once you provide the URL, the script will send a request to the Google Play Store website and retrieve the current running version of the application. It will display the fetched version on the console. For example:
```
Current running version: 1.2.3
```
Congratulations! You have successfully used the GooglePlayStoreVersionChecker script to fetch the current running version of an application on the Google Play Store.

## Changelog
